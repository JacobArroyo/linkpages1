            <p>I have always been <b>obsessed with systems</b>. In the gym, that meant optimizing my biomechanics to pull a <b>242.5 kg deadlift</b>. In my professional life, it means <i>automating work that is usually done by hand</i>. I currently run an online coaching business where I design <b>automated Excel sheets</b> that calculate training loads and macronutrients instantly. I am also building simple <b>Point of Sale systems</b> for the micro-businesses of family friends so they can move away from manual tracking. This business is part of my long-term plan because the income it generates will fund my future enrollment in <b>Computer Engineering (BSCE)</b>. When I am not coding or lifting, I play <i>Factorio or RimWorld</i> to keep my mind sharp on logistics and systems design.</p>
            <p>That same drive for optimization pushed me toward my hardest technical challenge so far is building an <b>SAP (Simple As Possible) computer</b> from scratch. Even as a BSIT student, I spend my nights away from high-level code and deep in the <i>hardware side of technology</i>. Constructing a CPU from <b>2N2222 transistors</b> only has shown me what real engineering looks like. I recently spent three nights debugging an <b>SR latch with D and NOT D</b> because the output was stuck at 4.3 volts, too low for the system to work correctly since it has to be exactly 5.</p>
            <p>My path forward is <b>structured and intentional</b>. Right now, I am scaling my online coaching and Point of Sale systems to fund my future studies in Computer Engineering, while also building and optimizing an SAP-1 computer using 2N2222 transistors. My next step is to transition from BSIT into BSCE or complete the prerequisite courses for a <b>master’s program in Computer Engineering</b>. From there, I plan to move from breadboards and into <b>custom PCB design</b> so I can turn experimental circuits into real hardware. Along the way, my technical focus is on understanding logic at the component level, organizing complex wiring to reduce errors, improving the automation in my coaching tools, and developing the <i>patience required</i> to finish long-term engineering projects even while trying to learn calculus as a side quest.</p>

            <h2>The Computer Engineering Roadmap:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Current: Scale the <b>Online Coaching and PoS business</b> to fund future BSCE/Masters studies</li>
                <li>Current: Successfully build and optimize the <b>SAP-1 Computer</b> using 2N2222 transistors</li>
                <li>Transition from BSIT to <b>BSCE</b> or enroll in Master's prerequisite BSCE courses</li>
