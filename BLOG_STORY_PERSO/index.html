    <h1><u>My Athletic Diary</u></h1>

        <div class="blogcontent">
            
            <p>I started swimming when I was <b>eight years old</b> because my mother used to swim and dreamed of becoming one and in a way, she <i>passed that dream to me</i>. On my very first competition with Speedo, I won a <b>gold medal</b> in a team event which pushed me to continue competing until Grade 6. During those years, I joined around five to ten competitions, bringing home mostly silver and bronze medals and one gold from the <b>Philippine Swim League</b> and <b>Speedo Jumpstart events</b>.</p>
            
            <p>Then in Grade 6, I stopped competing and focused on helping my coach teach younger swimmers while still training seriously. When the pandemic hit all training stopped and I spent most of my time at home playing Counter Strike on my PC. In Grade 9, a friend introduced me to <b>Olympic fencing</b>, which I pursued for about three years despite a <i>physically and mentally draining journey</i>. I trained with intensity, often 7AM to 7PM on non-school days and 6AM to 12AM while balancing school and long commutes, but I struggled with my technical progress and my peers who started same as me advanced faster than I did. Eventually, the <i>pressure, burnout, and internal conflict</i> made me leave fencing altogether despite invested so much of my time, money, my physical and mental wellbeing it was not worth my time being in a <b>toxic training club</b>.</p>
            
            <p>During my final year in fencing in 2023, I was introduced to the gym and quickly <i>fell in love</i> with <b>powerlifting</b>, focusing on the squat, bench, and deadlift. Despite suffering a <b>disc herniation</b> in 2024 while deadlifting which made me immobilized and in <i>gut wrenching nerve pain</i> for 3 months, I recovered through self-research, physical therapy, and determination, and then returned stronger under proper coaching. In August 2025, I competed in the <b>Luzon Equipped Nationals</b> in Robinsons Ortigas and scored a <b>175KG squat, 97.5KG bench, and a 225KG deadlift</b> but I almost got the 247.5KG on the last attempt. Although I am still managing my injury, I continue to grow stronger every day, driven by <i>resilience and passion</i> for the sport.</p>
