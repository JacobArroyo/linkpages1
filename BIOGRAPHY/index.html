  <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
  <p>
    I grew up as a <strong>dedicated swimmer</strong>.<sup>1</sup> 
    I spent most of my childhood <em>training and competing</em> from Grade 1 to Grade 10.<sup>2</sup> 
    I specialized in <b>freestyle</b> and <b>backstroke</b>, earning many medals while competing in the Philippine Swim League and numerous Speedo Events.<sup>3</sup> 
    During that time, I was also the <u>team captain</u> of the Mezza Swim Team, which strengthened my discipline and leadership with my teammates.<sup>4</sup> 
    Even though I wasn’t very social, I still took on the responsibilities given to me by my coach.<sup>5</sup> 
    I always had a world of my own, especially in school.<sup>6</sup> 
    I tended to be quiet and focused on my personal goals, finding comfort in my own space.<sup>7</sup> 
    Swimming taught me <strong>perseverance</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, and how to stay committed to long-term goals.<sup>8</sup> 
    I enjoyed pushing myself to improve, even on days when practice felt exhausting.<sup>9</sup> 
    My childhood in swimming shaped much of my identity, giving me <em>confidence</em> and a strong sense of discipline.<sup>10</sup> 
    I learned how to handle both wins and losses gracefully.<sup>11</sup> 
    I also developed a mindset of personal improvement that carried over into other aspects of my life.<sup>12</sup> 
    Even outside the pool, I often set goals for myself and worked quietly to achieve them, especially when reading books.<sup>13</sup> 
    Swimming was more than just a sport, it became a foundation for my character.<sup>14</sup> 
    It taught me the importance of routine, patience, and <strong>self-motivation</strong>.<sup>15</sup> 
    I also learned how to balance leadership with humility among my students and teammates.<sup>16</sup> 
    The friendships I made in the swim team enriched my childhood, even if I remained naturally reserved.<sup>17</sup> 
    These experiences shaped who I am today, being focused, determined, and quietly ambitious.<sup>18</sup> 
    I learned to manage pressure at a young age, especially during important competitions.<sup>19</sup> 
    These lessons helped me stay calm and focused even in challenging situations.<sup>20</sup>

  <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
  <p>
    As I entered my teenage years, I continued searching for what I wanted to do in the future.<sup>1</sup> 
    In senior high school, I took the ABM strand, inspired by the idea of becoming a <strong>rich person</strong> like the guy in the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street”.<sup>2</sup> 
    However, I eventually realized that the accounting side of business wasn’t really for me.<sup>3</sup> 
    In Grades 11 and 12, I also tried <b>fencing</b> and competed, but I realized I wasn’t cut out for it.<sup>4</sup> 
    Even with the long hours of training, often half the day outside of school, I wasn’t progressing as much as I wanted.<sup>5</sup> 
    Fencing taught me <em>patience</em>, <em>strategy</em>, and the value of persistence, even if it wasn’t my ultimate path.<sup>6</sup> 
    I continued to spend most of my time focusing on my own goals, maintaining the quiet, reserved nature I had carried from childhood.<sup>7</sup> 
    This period was important for <strong>self-discovery</strong>, helping me understand my strengths, weaknesses, and true interests and passion.<sup>8</sup> 
    I learned that trying new things is valuable, even if they don’t become a permanent pursuit for my future.<sup>9</sup> 
    My teenage years were a mix of experimentation, reflection, and preparation for what I truly wanted.<sup>10</sup> 
    They helped me develop <em>resilience</em> and humility.<sup>11</sup> 
    I also realized that personal growth doesn’t always require social interaction.<sup>12</sup> 
    I continued honing my discipline, balancing academics, sports, and personal goals.<sup>13</sup> 
    This stage of life really helped me return to my original passion with clarity and purpose.<sup>14</sup> 
    I understood that it was okay to try and fail, as long as I learned from the experience along the way.<sup>15</sup> 
    I began to appreciate the importance of <strong>time management</strong> and prioritization in achieving my goals.<sup>16</sup> 
    I also recognized that persistence often matters more than raw talent.<sup>17</sup> 
    These years taught me to trust my instincts when choosing which paths to pursue.<sup>18</sup> 
    By the end of my teenage years, I felt more confident in my decisions and more prepared for the challenges ahead.<sup>19</sup> 
    I carried these lessons forward as I approached the next chapter of my life.<sup>20</sup>

  <h2>College Years</h2>
  <p>
    When I reached college, I returned to what I had always been <strong>passionate about</strong>.<sup>1</sup> 
    I shifted to <b>BSIT</b>, choosing it over Computer Engineering and Computer Science mainly because I disliked Calculus.<sup>2</sup> 
    During this time, I discovered <strong>powerlifting</strong> through friends at the gym, and this sport immediately felt right for me.<sup>3</sup> 
    I trained, ate, slept, and dedicated myself fully to the sport, enjoying every moment.<sup>4</sup> 
    Eventually, I competed in August 2025, a huge milestone that pushed me even deeper into the sport.<sup>5</sup> 
    Today, I am not only a competitive powerlifter but also a <em>coach</em>, guiding my athletes as they prepare for their first competition in early February 2026.<sup>6</sup> 
    Powerlifting gave me direction, a way to turn my passion into a job, and a purpose to be the strongest in the 74kg division.<sup>7</sup> 
    It has also taught me <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>mentorship</strong>, and the importance of motivating others.<sup>8</sup> 
    College became a space for growth, both academically and personally.<sup>9</sup> 
    I learned to balance studies, training, and coaching responsibilities.<sup>10</sup> 
    Powerlifting reinforced <em>discipline</em>, perseverance, and the value of consistent effort.<sup>11</sup> 
    I also developed a sense of fulfillment in helping others achieve their goals.<sup>12</sup> 
    This sport shaped my identity in ways similar to swimming, but with a deeper understanding of <strong>strength</strong>, both physical and mental.<sup>13</sup> 
    Today, I continue to pursue excellence in my sport while preparing for a future that combines my passion for technology and athletics.<sup>14</sup> 
    I have learned to embrace challenges as opportunities for <strong>growth</strong>.<sup>15</sup> 
    Time management has become crucial, as I juggle training, coaching, and academics.<sup>16</sup> 
    I also discovered the importance of setting both <strong>short-term</strong> and <strong>long-term goals</strong>.<sup>17</sup> 
    Through powerlifting, I have built <em>resilience</em> that extends beyond the gym.<sup>18</sup> 
    These experiences continue to shape my mindset, preparing me for whatever comes next.<sup>19</sup> 
    They have also taught me to stay <strong>adaptable</strong>, ready to face challenges both in and out of the gym.<sup>20</sup>
