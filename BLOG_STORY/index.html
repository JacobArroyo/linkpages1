                    <p>I got my first <b>Nintendo DSI</b> with a <i>red shell</i> and a <i>Japanese firmware</i> when I was 7 years old. It was the device that truly started my journey with digital technology and software such as the flipbook drawing app called <b>FlipNote Studios</b> and the photo and audio editor it had. I was immediately <i>fascinated</i> by the screen, buttons, and the idea that I could <b>control what is happening</b> in this very device.</p>
                    <p>As a young kid, I spent countless hours experimenting with my Nintendo DSI settings and memorizing every button's look and effect since the console and game cartridges were all Japanese. I mostly relied on <b>trial and error</b> which taught me to <i>observe patterns</i> rather than depend on the instructions which is kind of fun. Over time I became confident in using the device and navigating the functions and features it has. These experiences helped me shape my <b>problem-solving skills</b> and made me more interested in technology especially in gaming.</p>
                    <p>Using the Nintendo DSI also helped me realize and understand how technology has this <i>response to user input</i>. Therefore I learned that every action like pressing a button or selecting an option produced a <b>specific result on the screen</b>, especially that one time I realized that some same game development companies have the same button functions, navigations, and feel in the game or the menu. So then I began to think about how games and applications were designed. This experience really made me interested and curious about <b>software, systems, and game development</b>.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Back in the early 2010s, my mother's co-worker would always invite us on the weekends so that us kids could hang out while they take care of their business. I would usually spend that time with Tin-Tin playing computer games like <b>Plants Vs. Zombies</b>, a bowling simulator, and a bunch of <i>2000s Electronic Arts games</i>. I instantly got hooked on these games quickly and one day Tin-Tin's older brother Cedric asked me if I wanted a laptop. At first, I thought he was joking, but he ended up showing me his <b>Acer Aspire 4736Z</b> laptop.</p>
                    <p>After getting the laptop, my mom took me to Sta. Mesa sometimes to choose some games, especially <i>Hidden Object Adventure games</i> from developers like <b>Big Fish Games</b> and <b>Elephant Studios</b>. These games were burned on CDs, so I had to load them on my laptop's CD player and run the installation wizard. It was an <i>entirely new experience</i>, learning how to install and manage software on a real computer for the first time because I'm very shy when it comes to computer shops.</p>
                    <p>Not to forget, I also got an original CD copy of <b>Plants vs Zombies</b>, which required the disc to run and read on the disc itself rather than installing it on the computer. Over time, the disc got full of scratches, and every time I wanted to play, it felt like a <i>gamble</i> whether it would even work. Despite these issues, having that laptop gave me my <b>first real taste of PC gaming and computer management</b>, and it completely fascinated me how a computer works which is why I always stick around on the Discovery channel waiting for the show <i>How Do They Do It?</i></p>

                <h2>Fascinations with Breadboard and CPU</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>I have a long-time fascination with <b>breadboards and electronic circuits</b>, but for a while, I only relied on YouTube tutorials. Because of this, I found it very challenging especially to read circuit schematics, which are very important when building a more complex project. I would usually spend hours thinking about what to try next until one day I decided to attempt <i>building a computer on a breadboard</i>. I researched whether it was even possible even with only a transistor and a bunch of LEDs instead of integrated circuit logic gates, and while it was <i>extremely difficult</i>, I realized I could build it if I try to <b>design every part myself</b> with the help of other project schemas and online forums.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I have successfully built a clock module using a <b>555 timer</b> with aluminum and ceramic capacitors and a bunch of resistors which control the clock speed and in the future I might as well change that function to using a potentiometer instead to easily change the speed. Onto the next part, I have 4 <b>Set and Reset Latches (SR Latch)</b> which stores 1 bit each, which makes the total input 4 bits. Currently, I am scouring the internet for schematics and studying how others built their own designs using only <i>transistors</i>. I am learning how to make logic gates, static memory cells, and how the clock module interacts with the register and how I would incorporate the data bus lane to the next part of the processor.</p>
                    <p>Despite struggling to read the schematics, I am determined to <b>create my own design</b>. Each experiment teaches me something new, and I am constantly improving my understanding of how a central processing unit and a group of transistors work. This project has not only improved my skills in electronics but also fuels my passion for computers and system design, showing me how much <i>creativity and logic</i> could go into making technology function.</p>
