                    <p>One of my massive software goals is to create a complex simulation game heavily inspired by masterpieces like <b>Dwarf Fortress</b> and <b>RimWorld</b>. I want to build a game engine that holds deep, emergent scenarios where the AI and systems interact in unpredictable ways.</p>
                    <p>Programming the logic, managing the memory for thousands of background events, and creating a world where every action has a chaotic or brilliant consequence is the ultimate test of my programming abilities.</p>

                    <p>For the past few weekends, trying to build my own <b>4-bit computer</b> on a breadboard has been driving me absolutely crazy. Dealing with the wiring, the logic gates, and the SR Latches has been a massive test of patience.</p>
                    <p>But getting this thing to finally work perfectly is high on my bucket list. I want to see those LEDs blink in perfect sequence, proving that I successfully designed and wired the CPU architecture myself. It will be the most satisfying victory.</p>

                    <p>Moving up from hardware, I want to write my own <b>Operating System</b> from scratch. I am deeply inspired by the technical feat of <i>Terry Davis and TempleOS</i>—the idea that one person can build an entire ecosystem, from the kernel to the compiler, without relying on massive, bloated libraries.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to create a system that is <b>compact yet highly functional</b> to modern standards. I want to handle memory management and write a custom kernel that stays "close to the metal," keeping the system lightweight but capable of running real-world applications. By following this path of extreme DIY development, I will finally bridge the gap between the <b>logic of my 4-bit hardware</b> and the high-level user software layer.</p>

                    <p>There is something incredibly fascinating about ancient engineering and how they preserved their history. Standing inside those monuments would be an unforgettable, surreal experience.</p>

                    <p>It's going to take relentless training, strict programming, and incredible mental toughness, but I am ready to put in the work to add those heavy kilos to my total and secure that #1 spot.</p>

After I finish my IT degree, I plan to go back to college for <b>Computer Engineering</b> to master the physical side of tech.</p>
                    <p>I don't just want to understand circuits; I want to <b>design my own PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards)</b> and build fully functional, professional-grade devices from the ground up. Having a background in both IT and Computer Engineering will give me the ultimate hybrid skillset—allowing me to bridge the gap between <b>low-level hardware fabrication</b> and high-level network and software architecture. I want to be the person who not only writes the code but also builds the very machine it runs on.</p>
